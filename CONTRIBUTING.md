In order to accept your contribution, you must accept our contributor license agreement.
We use the [cla-assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) to automatically verify for every pull request that the author accepted the CLA.

## Submit a pull request
Please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository into your own github account.
2. Create your changes on top of the `community` branch.
3. Please make sure to keep your changes in a single commit (use `amend` instead of multiple commits)
4. Push this commit to a new feature branch in your repository.
5. Create a pull request in this repository with the base branch `community` and your repository and feature branch as head.

We will create an internal code review request which will be tested with our continuous integration pipeline.
If these tests are successful, the developer team will decide if the pull request will be accepted. 
In case of a favourable decision the changes will be added to our internal code base and will be included with the next release.  
The pull request will also be merged into the `community` branch, so that you can use it before it is officially released.
Every release will then be merged into the `community` branch.
